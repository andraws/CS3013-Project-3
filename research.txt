LEARNING THREADING, HERE WE GO

Thread creation:
pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(start_routine) (void *), void *arg);
ex: pthread_create(&p, NULL, mythread, &args)
* pthread_t * thread -> pointer to struct of type pthread_t, interact with thread
* const pthread_attr_t * attr -> any values thread might have
